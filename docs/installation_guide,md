# Installation Guide – IoT Home Automation and Security System

This guide walks you through the hardware setup, wiring structure, power management, and firmware installation for your ESP32 + Arduino Mega–based smart home automation and security system.

---

## System Overview

- **ESP32** handles the local web interface, appliance control, sensor monitoring, and wireless communication.
- **Arduino Mega** handles access control (RFID + keypad) and communicates with the ESP32 using NRF24L01 transceivers.
- Both boards are powered independently via **9V batteries regulated by buck converters**.

---

## Hardware Installation

### 1. Power Supply Setup

- Connect each **9V battery** to a **buck converter**.
  - Set buck output: **5V for relays and sensors**, **3.3V for NRF24L01**
- Use **capacitor filtering** (e.g., 10µF – 100µF electrolytic) on **NRF24L01 power line** to prevent brownouts.

> Ensure common ground between ESP32, relay module, and sensor modules.

### 2. ESP32 Unit – Web Server & Automation Node

**Modules connected**:
- DHT11 (temperature/humidity)
- Rain sensor
- PIR motion sensor
- Flame sensor
- 2-channel relay module
- NRF24L01 (SPI)
  
**Functions**:
- Hosts Wi-Fi dashboard (connects to existing router)
- Controls relays for connected appliances
- Reads sensor data and updates interface
- Receives wireless access control status from Mega

---

### 3. Arduino Mega Unit – Access Control Node

**Modules connected**:
- MFRC522 RFID reader (SPI)
- 4x4 Matrix keypad
- NRF24L01 (SPI)
- Relay or signal pin for door unlock trigger

**Functions**:
- Reads RFID tags and verifies PIN
- Sends access status (`GRANTED`/`DENIED`) to ESP32
- Activates lock relay if access is granted

---

## Wireless Communication

- Both ESP32 and Arduino Mega communicate **via NRF24L01 modules**
- Shared protocol:
  - Messages sent from Mega → ESP32:
    - `"ACCESS:GRANTED"`  
    - `"ACCESS:DENIED"`
  - Messages sent from ESP32 → Mega (if used): control or status commands

> Ensure unique addresses are assigned to each radio node.

## Firmware Upload

### 1. Flash ESP32

- Open `central_control.ino` in Arduino IDE
- Select board: `ESP32 Dev Module`
- Connect via USB
- Flash the sketch

### 2. Flash Arduino Mega

- Open `access_control.ino`
- Select board: `Arduino Mega or Mega 2560`
- Flash via USB

---

## Web Interface Access

1. Power on the ESP32 and wait for it to connect to your existing Wi-Fi.
2. Use the Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to find its assigned IP address.
3. Open the IP in a browser to access the control dashboard.
4. Login with the default credentials (editable in code).

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Power rails stable with regulated voltage (3.3V/5V)
- [ ] NRF24L01 modules show communication (check serial debug)
- [ ] Sensors respond as expected (motion, flame, rain, DHT11)
- [ ] Relay modules switch loads without noise or reset
- [ ] Access control workflow triggers proper actions
- [ ] Web interface is responsive and secure

## Notes

- Optional: Add ON/OFF switches on battery lines
- Optional: Use heat shrink and enclosures for safety
- Optional: Add status LEDs for access control and sensor states
