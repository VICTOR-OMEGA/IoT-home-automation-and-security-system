Smart home adoption is growing rapidly.

This project presents an IoT-based home automation and security system.

It uses two boards: ESP32 and Arduino Mega.

The ESP32 hosts a local web server with secure login.

Users can control devices via relays through a web interface.

It reads data from four sensors: DHT11, rain, PIR, and flame.

The system shows real-time environment status and reacts to motion/fire.

ESP32 communicates wirelessly with Arduino Mega via nRF24L01.

Arduino Mega handles access control via keypad and RFID.

The setup ensures only authorized access and remote control.

The system is modular, scalable, and reliable.

Ideal for automating and securing modern homes.
